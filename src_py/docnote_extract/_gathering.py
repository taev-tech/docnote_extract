    specified toplevel firstparty package names and then extracts
    summaries for all of them, returning a ``Docnotes`` collection
    describing all of the discovered docs. The importhook also applies
    a stubbing technique to all thirdparty dependencies, making docs
    generation significantly faster, and allowing docs generation
    virtualenvs to be much lighter-weight than the full package
    requirements. Generally speaking, absent any "nostub" configuration
    (see below), you will only need the passed ``firstparty_pkg_names``
    available in the docs generation virtualenv (in addition to
    ``docnote``, ``docnote_extract``, and any libraries needed for
    processing the resulting ``Docnotes``).

    **This will result in an ``exec`` of all modules within the
    firstparty packages and can only be used on trusted code!**

    Occasionally the import-hook-based extraction process can run into
    problems. In this case, it may be useful to declare either an
    entire package (firstparty or thirdparty) or a single module
    (firstparty only) as "nostub". This will bypass the import hook for
    that package or module, instead wrapping it in a tracking mechanism
    that will hopefully recover most of the downstream crossrefs to it.
    **This requires the package to be installed within the virtualenv
    used for docs extraction.**

    The downsides of a "nostub" approach are:
    ++  docs extraction will take longer. If the module has import side
        effects, that can be substantial
    ++  depending on the specifics of the un-stubbed module, it can
        result in a cascade of bypasses for its dependencies, and then
        their dependencies, and so on
    ++  it requires that module to be available within the virtualenv
        used for docs generation
    ++  you may run into issues with ``if typing.TYPE_CHECKING`` blocks
    ++  you can very quickly run into issues with traversals. This can,
        for example, cause problems with references to imported
        ``Enum`` members

    In short, you should avoid marking packages as ``nostub`` unless
    you run into problems directly related to stubbing, which cannot be
    solved by other, more precise, escape hatches (for example, using
    ``special_reftype_markers`` or ``DocnoteConfig.mark_special_reftype``
    to force a particular import to be a metaclass- or
    decorator-compatible stub).
